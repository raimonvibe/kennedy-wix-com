		<h1>About Ebay</h1>
		<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
		<h4>A brief history of eBay</h4>
		<p>eBay, founded in 1995 by Pierre Omidyar, is a global online marketplace for trade and
		auctions, initially operated as Auction Web in San Jose, California and was renamed eBay in
		1997. It was one of the first businesses to generate and advertise an online marketplace
		connecting consumers and sellers of products and services (Allie Grace Garnett, 2024).
      	This research explores the websites 			e-business models, 
		competitive strategy,digital
		marketing, customer traffic data, e-CRM, social network channels, and cyber security
		measures.</p>

	<div class="ebusiness">
		<h1>E-business models</h1>
		<h3>This model is a unique blend of three streams that are critical to the business, for
		example, the value stream for the business partners and the buyers, the revenue stream and
		logical stream (Mahadevan 2000).
		This paragraph highlights the E-Business models the website uses.</h3>
		<div class="model">	
			<div>
				<h2>Brokerage Model</h2>
				<p>eBay facilitates direct transactions between sellers and buyers, allowing
				sellers to list products like used electronics, clothing, and rare collectibles, where the seller is
				an individual or business selling directly to the buyer.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Advertising model</h2>
				<p>eBay's advertising model allows sellers to pay for;Promoted Listings
				to boost visibility in search results and product pages, generating diverse revenue streams
				like top-ranking listings for used iPhones.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Affiliate model</h2>
				<p>eBay uses this model for increased traffic, sales, cost effectiveness, and
				targeted promotions, like eBay Partner Network, where tech bloggers earn commissions on
				phone purchases.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="model2">
			<div>
				<h2>Subscription model</h2>
				<p>These subscription plans are typically aimed at sellers who want to list
				large quantities of products or require more advanced features.
				Example: A seller with a Premium Store subscription, can list up to 1,000 items per month for a flat monthly fee.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="top">
				<h2>Merchant model</h2>
				<p>eBay's merchant model allows businesses to sell directly to consumers,
				listing items individually or in bulk with fixed prices (Buy It Now) instead of auction-based listings.
				Example: A seller might list a;Sony 4K TV; for a fixed price of $799 with free shipping. This
				item would remain at this price unless the seller changes it.</p>

		<h1>Ebay's Strength and Weakness</h1>
		<div>
			<h2>Strengths</h2>
			<h3>Ease of navigation</h3>
			<p>eBay's website is generally easy to navigate. The homepage offers
			clear categories and a search bar for direct product searches.</p>
			<h3>User Interface:</h3>
			<p>While it's not necessarily the most modern in design, it is functional and
			serves its purpose. Some users may find the layout cluttered with ads, but overall, the
			search functionality and product listings are straightforward.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Weaknesses</h2>
			<h3>High Fees</h3>
			<p>eBay charges high fees, including listing, final value, and PayPal processing,
			which can be particularly costly for small sellers.</p>
			<h3>Complex Seller Policies/User Experience</h3>
			<p>eBay's seller policies can be complex, with
			sellers facing penalties for mistakes. Customer service can be challenging, with delayed
			responses and unclear guidance. The website can also feel cluttered, making navigation difficult</p>

		<h1>The competitive and digital business strategies of eBay</h1>
		<p>eBay leverages a combination of competitive and digital business strategies, by
		utilizing Porter's <br>Generic strategy of cost leadership and<br> differentiation combined with a
		strong digital business strategy.</p>
		<div class="flex">
			<div id="focus">
				<h3>Focus on Buyer-Seller Relationship</h3>
				<p>eBay differentiates itself by fostering trust between
				buyers and sellers through tools like ratings, feedback systems, and buyer protection policies (Laudon; Traver, 2020).</p>
				<img src="buy.avif">
			</div>
			<div id="focus">
				<h3>Global Reach and Niche Products</h3>
				<p>eBay allows users to buy and sell used and niche
				items, including collectibles and rare goods. This gives eBay a competitive advantage in
				catering to specialized markets (Grewal &amp Levy, 2022).</p>

				<h1>Digital business strategy</h1>
			<div class="flexup">
				<div>
					<h3>Digital Transformation</h3>
					<p>eBay uses AI and machine learning for product recommendations
					and pricing optimization, personalizing the shopping experience and enhancing customer
					retention. (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2020).</p>
					<img src="AI.avif" id="image1">
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Global expansion through Digital Channels</h3>
					<p>eBay&'s strategy involves expanding its digital
					presence in emerging markets, improving localized content, payment systems, and logistics
					to attract global customers (Chaffey & Ellis-Chadwick 2019).
					However, eBay&s auction and used goods model has seen declining returns compared to
					fixed-price listings and new product offerings, particularly in the;new product; and;fast</p>

			<h1>Recommendations</h1>
			<p>Improve Logistics and Delivery Systems/Enhance Mobile Experience</p>
			<h3>eBay's auction and used goods model has seen declining returns compared to fixed-price
			listings and new product offerings, particularly in the;new product; and;fast delivery;
			segments.
			eBay could improve its logistics infrastructure and mobile experience to compete with
			Amazon's efficient network and meet consumer expectations, while investing in user-friendly
			features like voice search integration and seamless checkout (Huang; Benyoucef, 2013,
			Kantar 2020).</h3>

			<h1>Customer Current Traffic Data</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="data1">	
			<p>According to Similarweb, eBay receives a significant amount of traffic, with an estimated
			609.2 million monthly visits (Similarweb, 2024). This suggests a large and active customerbase. 
			However, understanding where visitors come from (search engines, social media, direct
			traffic, etc.) helps tailor marketing strategies. Analysing metrics like bounce rate, average
			session duration, and page views per session reveals user engagement levels. Identifying
			user location helps localize marketing efforts and cater to regional preferences.</p>
			<img src="data.avif">
		</div>
		<h3>Recommendations</h3>
		<p>Analysing traffic sources allows eBay to optimize marketing campaigns. For example, if
		search engine traffic is high, focusing on keyword optimization can improve visibility.
		Conversely, if social media referrals are low, investing in social media marketing could be
		beneficial.

		<h3>Recommendations</h3>
		<p>Many users may not fully understand the importance of practices like using strong,
		unique passwords or enabling MFA. eBay could enhance account security by providing more
		educational resources, such as tutorials and reminders, to educate users on strong
		passwords and MFA, thereby enhancing account security. eBay(2024).eBay Security
